Objects:

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)
Numbers can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)
Strings can be objects (or primitive data treated as objects)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are objects

In JavaScript, all values, except primitive values, are objects.

Primitive values are: strings ("John Doe"), numbers (3.14), true, false, null, and undefined.
